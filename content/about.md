I'm Aswin Mohan, "jobless" Computer Science graduate from College of Engineering Chengannur in the year of the pandemic. I love to code and have been doing that since 2013, also loves designing because who hates beautiful things. I focus primarily on Mobile Experiences because the Web is too bloated for my taste.

I put most of my code here on [github.com/aswinmohanme](https://github.com/aswinmohanme), and some designs on [behance](https://behance.net/aswinmmohanme).
If you're looking to know more about me, here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q4k0yis-Jx-i8KCF7d6iAtJZoaG2RTw-), my contact details are inside.
