A Now page is someplace where you list what you are doing with your life right now. I came across this when reading [jon.bo](https://jon.bo/now), who got the idea from [nownownow.com/about](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Work

I'm working at [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) in the Mobile Team.

- Currently working on rewriting the entire app from scratch in React Native, so expect some great improvements coming along the way.

## Projects

[IndiePaper](https://indiepaper.me/) - The better way for Authors to make self-published books.

## Learning

Learning is almost always fun outside school. When there isn't anyone looking over your shoulder insisting you learn about inverse trignometric functions, you tend to hate learning.

### Done

- **Skill : Learn to solve the Rubiks Cube blind** - I have always been into cubing, but learning to solve it blind is like the ultimate challenge in memorization, and would make a cool party trick.

  - I successfully solved the cube blindfolded even though I lost the bet to solve it in 5 mins. The speed can be improved with practice.

- **Code: TDD Phoenix** - I have always found the idea of TDD fascinating. I'm currently learning TDD with Elixir Phoenix from the awesome free resource at [TDD Phoenix](https://www.tddphoenix.com/)
  - Learnt that writing Integration tests has the best ROI in all types of testing. So now I am practicing TDD with Integration Tests.

## Reading

For the love of Reading.

- **Leonardo Da Vinci, The Biography** by Walter Isaacson - It would be nice to figure out how the greatest inventor of Da Vinci figured out the stuff he did.
