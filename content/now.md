A Now page is someplace where you list what you are doing with your life right now. I came across this when reading [jon.bo](https://jon.bo/now), who got the idea from [nownownow.com/about](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Work
I'm working at [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) in the Mobile Team. We are currently working on rewriting the App from scratch, so expect some great improvements along the way.

## Projects
Currently none, I have some ideas lying around though.

## Learning
That is also none, well this is turning out to be a sad little now page.
