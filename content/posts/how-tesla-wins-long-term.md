Tesla the Apple of AutoMakers, when everyone is spending their billions on marketing their new cutting edge marginally better tech, Tesla is leapfrogging all of them to be crowned the most valuable auto-manufacturer on the planet. That is something to be celebrated and part of the celebration is what makes Elon Musk the third richest man on the planet.

With all the great press and the launching of stock prices that puts SpaceX to shame there should be some underlying reason why Tesla became the T-Rex that it is now. But this is not a history lesson. We are going to look why Tesla is in it for the long run and what we can learn from them to incorporate to our own products.

### Innovation
If there is one thing that is missing from the Automotive Industry that isn't a severe lack of love for the product is innovation. Granted doing something new in an Industry that is sitting around for close to 200 years is really hard and hovers near impossible but the dividens are enormous. Most people do not buy Tesla because of their undying devotion to the environment, most of us are hypocrites when it comes to those matters. People buy Tesla because it is the best car on the planet which just so happens to be an electic car. The features that Tesla has are not exclusive to electric cars, they can be ported to any such mechanical contraption with relative ease, but it is the features and the cohesive whole that they provide that make all the difference. The overall ingeniuty of the features and the sum is greater than the parts approach makes everyone who doesn't own a Tesla jealous of the Dog Feature and that is what makes up for the severe lack of advertisement budget. Tesla is not like any other car on the planet, it is like that new chick on the block that makes all the middle age men reconsider their marriage choices.

Even in industries drenched in decades of funding and bloodshed there will always be unexplored angles and wiggle room for innovation, but only if you care enough.

### Elon Musk
I know enough history to make sure that Elon Musk didn't just wake up one day with the idea for the Model S and since it was the weekend waited till monday to form Tesla, but nonetheless he is the major driving force behind what all Tesla has achieved. Companies are like little kids, they need your loving care until they reach a certain age and then they just diss over all your dreams. But like kids who take on the characteristics of their parents, companies seem to take in the characteristics of the person in charge, and Tesla has one hell of a parent in that way. Elon is driven by god knows what and combine it with a work ethic that hovers close to insane he is the parent that Tesla deserves and needed. 

Sure you can argue that Elon is just a guy with a warped sense of reality and asks his engineers to build stuff that is out of this world and forces them to make money, but it takes a truck load of guts to stand behind what you think and make it happen and bend reality to your will.
