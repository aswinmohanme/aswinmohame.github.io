Is there a God ? Some omnipotent power that watches over us, protects us, makes us dance like (his/her) little puppets ? That is the age old question, which has caused more bloodshed and hatred than what even an all knowing all controlling power couldn't have fathomed. If such a power exists alongside the universe, which religion comes close to it's defintion, which religion is closest to god ? Or are there multiple gods, enough for everyone and how do they decide what to do as a collective god like species ? Even if we could prove the existence of God, are we a much simpler life form supposed to question it ? If there's a God, like wtf was 2020 ?

## What is God ?
Before we pick up the blowtorch, we first need to have a common understanding of God. God is the omnipotent power which each religion takes for granted. The judgemental authority on humans.
