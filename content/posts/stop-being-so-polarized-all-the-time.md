Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.

Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well  formed and so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument anytime soon. I have seen decade old friendships end because of differing political opinions, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of this.

We all have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn't make everything a part of their identity and where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a brawl. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.

## Enter Social Media
There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us humans it was when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it's forms isn't  inherently bad, it's when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep track of your friends and family  start to keep a track on you.

Advertisement has always been about attention, that's why you see big billboards lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won't probably need kept neatly on the side. The sole purpose of it is to turn your  head and to make  you take notice. They didn't care who saw it, they just cared a lot of us did.

A lot of advertisement on the early days of  the internet was similar, the would  put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.

Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in Ad  town from  then on and the  Social Media companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the downfall of the civilization started. (Too far ? yeah too far)

After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladly served them up on a plate.

But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do they started manufacturing them.

Big Social realized that the people who  engage  most, who  drive the most revenue are the ones obsessed with the content. They are the most  revenue generating cattle of the ranch, and since everything is a numbers game they started to maximize obsessiveness. Well how do you manufacture people who would die for their views ? How do you manufacture obsessiveness ? Bubbles.

## Enter Bubbles
The more the number of positive reinforcement that a person receives about their already existing viewpoints and the more number  of negative reinforcements they see around the opposing ones, the more likely they are to believe their beliefs are true. The more they are engrossed in their bubbles the more they are susceptible to being obsessed.

The  first  time we sign-up for it, they don't know anything about us. So they ask us for our interests and to add our closest friends. Based on that they show us some generic content  based on our and  our friends interests. Then we start interacting with them, each and every interaction, each and  every pause is recorded and measured and converted  to a  data point. Initially the content is neutral, leaning just to the side  of our interests and our beliefs. The more we interact with it, the more the virtual  profile of ourselves get optimized. With our likes and shares and comments  we build an echo chamber around ourselves, with help from a  black box algorithm designed to optimize  for obsessiveness.

But an echo chamber doesn't make you and obsessed radical, what makes you one is shock.

## Enter Shock
Shock is what pushes your towards the edge of obsessiveness. Content that has high shock value are borderline impossible to believe. They rock your belief system and lingers on the edge of possibility. It's purpose is not to make you believe the content right away, but to expand and reinforce your viewpoint so much so that you believe a little more polarized content than what you are used to. That is how you manufacture obsessiveness, that's how your manufacture  polarization. The cycle is repeated indefinitely nudging you little by little to the edge, until you fall  o ver. Is  it  intentional or  a  byproduct  of an algorithm optimized for profit and engagment maximization is up for debate.

Consider me and Youtube. Like every teenager I had trouble with the ladies and like any other teenager I turned  to the internet for answers. I started with dating videos, content which I  was looking for. Then slowly my recommended feed stared to show just one or two videos on how women were the problem of modern society, not enough to turn me to a believer but just enough to shock me. Having been exposed to that I started to normalize videos that bash feminism, SJW's being owned and rants about how women are the problem. Then my feed started to get populated with  even more  anti-women and videos around red-pill and the manosphere. I am not saying these viewpoints are right or  wrong, but they were shocking  and normalized  a lot  of stuff that I would never have accepted if I was shown then from the start. After a while I started believing a lot of the stuff that was being said, I was starting to suffocate in my own bubble. Luckily I used to read a lot and hence had access to contrasting view points. That's when I realized how deep in the rabbit hole I was. This prompted me to seek out alternate viewpoints and form my own opinions.  If I had kept going I would most probably have turned  into an angry fanatic thristy for blood on the internet.

That's what  the algorithms are designed to do. They have the maximum engagment and attention from how obsessed thier users  are. For being obsessed it's not only vital that you  push the view point forward but also to demean and dehumanize the opposing one, so much so to the point that you believe the views that they hold are clearly wrong.  It pushes us into an us vs them mentatlity, where we are the right ones  and they are the wrong ones  It pushes us into an us vs them mentatlity, where we are the right ones  and they are the wrong ones.

After a while we start to internalize what we interact with, it becomes a part of your identity.You start to believe the extreme content that you are exposed to as your own, you start to defend it with all your might.  You can't entertain an  argument  because it is no  longer an argument  against your opinion,but one against  your identity. To entertain any argument is to acknowledge you are wrong and to prove everything you have interacted with for a long time to be wrong. This is  what  polarizes  us, this is what makes having a friendly conversation about opposing  views impossible in this  day and age. This is what is being done to us. We are divided  by opinipons cocooned in our own bubbles, our own  echo chambers which enforce our beliefs and makes us immune to any counter  argument no matter how right or wrong.

## Breaking Out
It's not easy and fun getting out once you are inside. It's like the matrix you see and hear and interact with an artificial world designed to hook you in, and like Neo it's one hell of a ride to unplug. It's hard but it's possible, this is how I  did it.

- Clear the data that they have on you, take away the data and take away the power.
- Humanize the opposing view points and the people who make  them. Realize they too have a valid point and that they belive it enough to defend it with all their heart.
- Seek out alternate view points, it's kind of a fun exercise. When you start everything looks stupid and dumb, persist and after a while you will feel a switch inside your brain, when you realize they also have a valid point.
- Take some time off and  think deeply about everything and put together a version of the reality and form your own opinions based on them.
- Refine those opinions  as you learn more about reality.

The world is a fun place. It' designed  to be  fun to live  in and to have fun with your friends. Don't spoil it in endless debates  and unneccessary brawl fights with the people whom you care about because some bits on a server decided to make you an obsessed fanatic.

Stop being so polarized all the time.
