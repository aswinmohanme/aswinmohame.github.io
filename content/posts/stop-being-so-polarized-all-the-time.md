Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.

Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well  formed and so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument anytime soon. I have seen decade old friendships end because of differing political opinions, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of this.

We all have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn't make everything a part of their identity and where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a brawl. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.

## Enter Social Media
There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us humans it was when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it's forms isn't  inherently bad, it's when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep track of your friends and family  start to keep a track on you.

Advertisement has always been about attention, that's why you see big billboards lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won't probably need kept neatly on the side. The sole purpose of it is to turn your  head and to make  you take notice. They didn't care who saw it, they just cared a lot of us did.

A lot of advertisement on the early days of  the internet was similar, the would  put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.

Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in Ad  town from  then on and the  Social Media companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the downfall of the civilization started. (Too far ? yeah too far)

After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladily served them up on a plate.

But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do they started manufacturing them.
